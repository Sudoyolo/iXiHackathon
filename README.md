# iXiHackathon

- Team Name: Binary Pods
- Team Members: Ankit Kumar Jha, Sanket Agarwal, Ishan Bansal
- We are working on theme: Online Education and Doubt Solving
- We plan to build a website 
- The target audience is school students
- Often school students have doubts regarding certain topics that they are taught. Through our website, the students can ask their doubts to proffesonal educators and teachers.
- Young minds face a lot of peer pressure. Many students refrain asking doubts to their teachers in front of their peers in the fear that if they ask a silly question, their friends would judge them and make fun of them. This is incorrect as without proper understanding of a topic, the student could face many problems in the future related to that topic. The problem, of not asking questions that cross one's mind due to hesistation, is extremely dangerous and can act as roadbloacks to excellence and self-development. With this thought in mind, we wanted to solve this problem with an aim of creating a website which would require a login:
1. Student Login - Each student entering a meeting will be entered as an anonymous person to other students. Not knowing which student is which, the peer pressure can be nullified and hence the students can ask their doubts without any hesitation.
2. Teacher Login - A Teacher organising a meeting, unlike a student, will be have full access to the names of attendees and who's asking doubts. This will be possible as Student Login IDs will be visible to only Teacher Login IDs. To another student, everyone besides the teacher still remains anonymous. This is required to maintain discipline during the meeting, so that teacher can monitor each student and during a troublesome situation, knows which student is misbehaving.
